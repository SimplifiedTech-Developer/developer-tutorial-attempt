How to use Kafka with Publisher and Consumer Example.

#Pre-Requisites
Pre-Requisites
install docker-compose https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/

modify the KAFKA_ADVERTISED_HOST_NAME in docker-compose.yml to match your docker host IP (Note: Do not use localhost or 127.0.0.1 as the host ip if you want to run multiple brokers.)

if you want to customize any Kafka parameters, simply add them as environment variables in docker-compose.yml, e.g. in order to increase the message.max.bytes parameter set the environment to KAFKA_MESSAGE_MAX_BYTES: 2000000. To turn off automatic topic creation set KAFKA_AUTO_CREATE_TOPICS_ENABLE: 'false'

Kafka's log4j usage can be customized by adding environment variables prefixed with LOG4J_. These will be mapped to log4j.properties. For example: LOG4J_LOGGER_KAFKA_AUTHORIZER_LOGGER=DEBUG, authorizerAppender

NOTE: There are several 'gotchas' with configuring networking. If you are not sure about what the requirements are, please check out the Connectivity Guide in the Wiki

Install kafka in windows :
-----------------------------
```cmd
docker-compose up -d
```
# Important Information
It is important to have KAFKA_ADVERTISED_LISTENERS set or you wonâ€™t be able to connect to Kafka from an external application. More information on this topic can be found here, which I found extremely useful when I did this incorrectly.

## Useful Commands
Start a cluster
```cmd
docker-compose up -d
```
Add more brokers
```cmd
docker-compose scale kafka=3
```
Destroy a cluster
```cmd
docker-compose stop
```
